**Some badges and compatibility**

This package is losely based on a software package that was I wrote at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and replaces that specific
package, which can in it's archived form be found 
[here](https://github.com/LLNL/iniabu). That package is v0.3.0 and was
released under GPL v2.0.
 
This is a new and improved version that is also available as a PyPi
package and replaces that older version. The new package is not
backwards compatible and is initially released as v1.0.0.

## ToDo:

* Write the package
* Write the test suite
* Travis Integration
* Automatic PyPi deployment from master branch
* Online documentation autogenerated from docstring
